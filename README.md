# CardioPredict: Machine Learning for Heart Disease Prediction

## Overview

CardioPredict is a data science project aimed at leveraging machine learning to predict the likelihood of heart disease or heart attack. The project focuses on identifying key drivers of heart disease using healthcare-related data, contributing to the early detection and prevention of cardiovascular conditions. This repository contains the code, dataset, and insights developed as part of the Advanced Certificate Program in Data Science.
## Key Features

* Predict the probability of a patient developing heart disease or experiencing a heart attack.
* Identify and rank the most critical risk factors for heart disease.
* Utilize advanced data science techniques, including feature engineering, class imbalance handling, and model evaluation.
* Compare multiple machine learning models for optimal performance.
* Provide an end-to-end pipeline for training and inference.
## Technology Used

* Programming Language: Python
* Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
* Tools: Jupyter Notebook
* Dataset: Heart Disease Health Indicators BRFSS 2015 dataset
